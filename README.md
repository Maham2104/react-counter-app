"React Counter App"

A simple React project to demonstrate props and state management.

Features:

- Display counter value
- Increment and Decrement buttons
- Reset button
- Counter history
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Animated counter when value changes

Learning Outcomes:

- Understand how state works to manage changing data
- Learn how to pass props from parent to child component
- Practice creating interactive React components

How It Works:

- State is used in `App.js` to store the counter value.
- Props are used to send the counter value and functions to `Counter.js`.
- Clicking buttons updates the state and re-renders the child component.
